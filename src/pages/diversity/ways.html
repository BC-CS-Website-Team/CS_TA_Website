        “The Zoroastrians arrive in India, their ships arriving in Sanjan and being met by the local raja, or king. Lacking a common language, the raja presented the refugees with a full glass of milk, indicating that there was no place for them. The Zoroastrians responded by adding a spoonful of sugar to the milk, demonstrating that they would blend into their surroundings and sweeten the proverbial glass of milk without causing it to overflow.” Parsis’s folktale.
