## Project Structure Insights

This structure represents a static website with multiple pages and sections, using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The separation of concerns (HTML for structure, CSS for presentation, JS for behavior) is well-maintained. The use of component files and the organization of pages into subdirectories keeps the codebase DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) and maintainable. The structure with subdirectories for main sections (career-dev, creative-space, diversity) allows for better organization and scalability.
