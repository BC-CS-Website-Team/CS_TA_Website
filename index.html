                <h2>What is Computer Science?</h2>
                <p>&emsp; &ensp;
                    Computer scientists have transformed the world we live in,
                    and with a computer science degree, you can become the next leader in our
                    technology-driven society. With four areas of concentration, hands-on
                    curriculum,
                    <a href="https://berea.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/catalog/departments-of-study/computer-science/computer-and-information-science-b-a/" target="_blank" title="Computer and Information Science B.A.">(View classes here!)</a>
                    a caring and accessible faculty, and numerous labor and
                    co-curricular opportunities, you'll be ready to create the next great
                    advancement in technology. Coming in 2024, our new technology building will
                    support opportunities to explore advanced computing subjects in our
                    interactive robotics and visualization lab, a makerspace designed to foster
                    creativity and exploration, and a hands-on networking and security lab.

                <p>&emsp; &ensp;
                    We've designed an inclusive curriculum that begins with the
                    basics of programming and data structures, and culminates with advanced
                    topics in computer science and a capstone experience. The curriculum is also
                    flexible enough to support students starting with no prior computing
                    experience, as well as students who've taken computer science courses prior
                    to Berea, meeting you where you are in your computing journey. With
                    conferences, hack-a-thons, internships, research opportunities, and a robust
                    labor program, students graduate from the computer science major with
                    real-world, hands-on experience that makes them competitive in today's
                    market.
