Figma Workflow Guide for Web Project
Role of Figma in the Project

Visual Design: Create the overall look and feel of the website
Layout Planning: Design the structure of each page
Collaboration: Allow team members to contribute ideas visually
Prototyping: Create interactive prototypes to test user flow
Design System: Establish color schemes, typography, and reusable components
Handoff: Provide developers with design specifications and assets

Workflow Steps
1. Initial Setup (1-2 sessions, whole team)

Create a Figma account and project
Invite all team members to the project
Introduce basic Figma interface and tools

2. Design Brainstorming (1-2 sessions, whole team)

Collect inspiration and reference websites
Discuss project goals and target audience
Sketch rough ideas for homepage layout

3. Create Design System (Core Team + interested members)

Define color palette
Choose typography
Design basic UI components (buttons, forms, etc.)

4. Page Layout Design (Team leads + 1-2 members per page)

Create frames for each main page
Design layout using the established design system
Add placeholder content

5. Review and Iteration (Whole team)

Present designs to the entire team
Gather feedback and make revisions
Ensure consistency across pages

6. Prototyping (Optional, for those interested)

Create basic interactions
Test user flow between pages

7. Design Handoff

Organize layers and components
Add any necessary annotations
Ensure developers have access to the Figma project

Tips for Figma Beginners

Start with the basics: shapes, text, and layout tools
Use Figma's tutorial resources and community templates
Don't aim for perfection initially; focus on communicating ideas
Collaborate in real-time and don't be afraid to experiment

Ongoing Use

Update Figma designs as the project evolves
Use it for new feature brainstorming
Refer back to it for design consistency

Learning Opportunities Analysis
Current Structure Learning Benefits

HTML/CSS Basics: All teams work directly with HTML and CSS
Content Management: Each team manages specific content areas
Version Control: All use Git/GitHub for collaboration
Design Principles: Applied when creating page layouts
Responsive Design: Implemented across all pages
Accessibility: Considered in content and design choices
Team Collaboration: Small team dynamics and cross-team interaction

Areas for Improvement

JavaScript Exposure: Limited in current structure
Advanced CSS Techniques: Not explicitly addressed
Performance Optimization: Not a focus in the current setup
Backend Integration: Not included in the current scope
