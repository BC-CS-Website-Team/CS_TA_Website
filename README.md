# CS TA Website Project

## Overview
This project is a collaborative web development effort to create a comprehensive website for our Computer Science Teaching Assistant (TA) program. It serves as both a learning experience for TAs of various skill levels and a practical tool for showcasing our program.

## Features
- Home page with program overview
- Committee pages (Tech Career Dev, Creative Space, Stars)
- Clubs information page
- TA profiles page
- Contributions page for program impact
- Alumni showcase
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop viewing

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Git
- A modern web browser
- Text editor (e.g., VSCode, etc.)

### Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/BC-CS-Website-Team/CS_TA_Website.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd CS_TA_Website
   ```
3. Open `index.html` in your web browser to view the site locally.

### Running the Site
This is a static website, so there's no need for a server or build process to run it locally. Simply:

1. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
2. You can do this by double-clicking the file in your file explorer, or by dragging and dropping it into an open browser window.
3. To see changes as you work:
   - Edit the HTML, CSS, or JavaScript files in your text editor.
   - Save the changes.
   - Refresh the page in your browser to see the updates.

For a more dynamic development experience, you can use a simple local server:
1. If you have Python installed, you can run:
   - For Python 3.x: `python -m http.server` You may need to type "python3"
   - For Python 2.x: `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`
2. Then open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

Alternatively, you can use extensions in your code editor (like "Live Server" in VSCode) to create a local server with live reloading.

## Development Workflow
1. Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix:
   ```
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```
2. Make your changes in the appropriate files.
3. Test your changes locally by opening the relevant HTML files in your browser.
4. Commit your changes:
   ```
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add a descriptive commit message"
   ```
5. Push your branch to GitHub:
   ```
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```
6. Create a Pull Request on GitHub for review.
