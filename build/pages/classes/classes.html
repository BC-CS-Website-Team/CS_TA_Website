    <h2>Required Core Courses</h2>
    <div class="course-section">
        <h3>CSC 226: Software Design and Implementation</h3>
        <p>In this course, students learn to design and implement software with an emphasis on object-oriented design. The course will include pseudocode, stepwise refinement, and testing for algorithm development. Other programming topics include data types, arrays, structures, functions, and files.</p>

        <h3>CSC 236: Data Structures</h3>
        <p>This course continues the study of software design and implementation from an object-oriented perspective. The design and implementation of software is fundamentally about tradeoffs between how fast our code runs and the amount of memory it consumes while running. We will explore the common structure used to represent data (queues, lists, trees, and hash tables, to name a few), the design tradeoffs we must make when choosing between them, and the experimental analysis of our algorithms and structures as expressed in code.</p>

        <h3>CSC 246: Scalable Algorithms & Objects</h3>
        <p>Weaving ethics as a theme throughout, this course will teach students to utilize professional software engineering techniques and tools as they deepen their understanding of object-oriented design and implementation and utilize more complicated data structures including sets, red-black trees, heaps, graphs, maps, and hash maps/tables. Students will extend their learning about the scalability of algorithms as they explore important algorithmic techniques such as string matching, subsequence matching, regular expressions, backtracking, divide and conquer, greedy strategies, branch and bound, dynamic, and randomization.</p>
