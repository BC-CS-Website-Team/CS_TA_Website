# CS TA Website Project

## Overview
This project is a collaborative web development effort to create a comprehensive website for our Computer Science Teaching Assistant (TA) program. It serves as both a learning experience for TAs of various skill levels and a practical tool for showcasing our program.

## Features
- Home page with program overview
- Committee pages (Tech Career Dev, Creative Space, Stars)
- Clubs information page
- TA profiles page
- Contributions page for program impact
- Alumni showcase
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop viewing

## Documentation

- For comprehensive project details, including its purpose and goals, please see: `documentation/project-details.md`

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Git
- A modern web browser
- Text editor (e.g., VSCode, Sublime Text)

### Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/hamiltonnBC/CS_TA_Website.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd CS_TA_Website
   ```
3. Open `index.html` in your web browser to view the site locally.

### Running the Site
This is a static website that can be run locally:

1. Open terminal in the project root directory
2. Run the local server:
   ```
   python server.py
   ```
3. Open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser

For a more dynamic development experience, you can use extensions in your code editor (like "Live Server" in VSCode) to create a local server with live reloading.
